# Gracefulexit

A graceful exit (or graceful handling) is a simple programming idiom[citation needed] wherein a program detects a serious error condition and "exits gracefully" in a controlled manner as a result. Often the program prints a descriptive error message to a terminal or log as part of the graceful exit.
